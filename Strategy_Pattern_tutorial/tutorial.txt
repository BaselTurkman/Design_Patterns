1. **Add a New Duck Type:**
   - Create a new duck type called `ModelDuck`.
   - The `ModelDuck` cannot fly but can quack.

2. **Modify Fly Behavior at Runtime:**
   - Update the code to demonstrate how to change the flying behavior of the `ModelDuck` at runtime.
   - Make the `ModelDuck` capable of flying like a rocket dynamically.

3. **Update the Duck Class:**
   - Refactor the `Duck` class to support dynamic behavior changes for flying.

4. **Add New Fly Behavior:**
   - Introduce a new flying behavior: *fly as a rocket*.

5. **Simulator Demonstration:**
   - In the simulation, show how to:
     - Create a `ModelDuck`.
     - Change its flying behavior to *fly as a rocket* during runtime.
     - Display the updated behavior.

• The algorithm contains the following steps:
• building foundation
• building pillars
• building walls
• building windows

Requirement:
• Define the template method that contains the steps for

• no subclass should be allowed to override it
• Building window should be default to glass window but
defined in away that allow different implementation
• Building foundation should be implemented in away to be
common and not possible to change it
